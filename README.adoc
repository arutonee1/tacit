= tacit

This is a set of combinators from combinatory logic for OCaml.

`lib/tacit.ml` has a listing of all included combinators and their aliases.
The `Tacit.Infix` module can be opened for easy access.
It is recommended to alias the `Tacit` module as something easier to type, i.e. `module C = Tacit`.
A recommended file heading may look as follows:
[source,ocaml]
----
(* other imports *)
module C = Tacit
open C.Infix
----
